# Missile-Defense

An attempt at building a missile defense system using Unity and NEAT:

Goal of the project is to teach a missile defense system to shoot down incoming missiles using neural evolution of augmented topologies (NEAT).


Created some general terrain, added planes and a missile spawn. The planes were added to test if the NEAT algorithm could discern between incoming rockets and civillian aircraft.

Added enemy missiles and explosion upon impact with a friendly missile. The friendly missiles now track the enemy missile (not using NEAT).
